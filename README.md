# Learning Testing

Playground to learn about everything related to testing in Javascript.

## Goals

I aim to implement the following things:

### Static Analysis Testing

- [x] linting
- [x] Typescript
  - [x] type, in iterface
  - [x] generics
  - [ ] function overloading
- [x] husky & lint-staged to run all checks automatically when committing
- [x] Run on CI

### Jest

- [ ] Jest config
- [ ] Different Jest matchers
  - [ ] Async test
  - [ ] Setup & teardown
- [ ] Mocks
  - [ ] Methods
  - [ ] Classes
  - [ ] Modules
- [ ] Snapshots
- [ ] Code coverage
  - [ ] Thresholds
  - [ ] codecov reports
- [x] watch mode setup

  - [x] chrome debugger setup
  - [ ] jest runners
  - [ ] watch plugins

- [ ] Testing library
- [ ] E2E /w Cypress
- [ ] MSW
- [ ] vue-test-utils

## Getting started

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn i
```

Start development server:

```bash
yarn serve
```

## Interesting lessons learned

### Jest `--watch` mode

- how to run
- debugger
- watch-plugins
